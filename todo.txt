currently doing:
u changed structure of productlist
u now fixing cart to adjust to new productlistoption to show per card
so that on click card it will have the id of the variant to call getProductItem
so that no need for use state to store what item is currently selected, 
just fetch new data on change of option

and now the animations don't work
